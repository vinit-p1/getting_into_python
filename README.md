# Getting into Python

Welcome to the "Getting into Python" repository! This repository is dedicated to various assignments and projects related to Python that I have completed while learning the language. Below is a brief description of the different assignments and their objectives:

## Assignment 1: Web Scraping with Selenium
In this assignment, I created a Python script that utilizes Selenium to interact with the website of the Polish Press Agency ([PAP](https://www.pap.pl/)). The script performs the following tasks:
- Accepts cookies
- Enlarges the browser window to full screen
- Changes the website language to English
- Navigates to the Business section
- Downloads all titles from the Business section
- Downloads all photos from this section to the local drive
- Scrolls down the page
- Goes to the last page and prints its number (text attribute)

## Assignment 2: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
This task focused on object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. I created classes for `Dog` and `Cat`, both of which inherit from the `Animal` class. The assignments for these classes involved defining methods such as `woof()` and `purr()`, adding attributes like `isAlive`, `gender`, and `genus`, and implementing the `breed()` method. Additionally, I handled exceptions when using the `breed()` method to ensure attribute compatibility.

## Assignment 3: Hangman Game 
For this assignment, I worked on two parts:
a) I created a `Game` class with a `number_of_players` field and a protected `play()` method. Then, I implemented a `Hangman` class that inherits from `Game` to play a hangman game with two playersâ€”one writing a word to guess and the other guessing letters.

Feel free to explore the code and assignments in this repository to get an insight into my journey of learning Python. Your feedback and suggestions are always welcome!
